# VSDSquadron-internship
This is the VSDSquadron research internship program which is done using RISC-V development board. This board is powered by CH32VOO3F4U6 chip with 32 bit RISC-V core based tool. It includes a built-in factory-trimmed 24MHz RC oscillator, 128KHz RC oscillator and a 24MHz oscillator for varing clock requirements. It offers multiple communication protocol including US-ART, 12C and SPI for versatile connectivity. It is eqipped with 2KB SRAM for volatile data storage, 16KB flash memory and 1920B for bootloader functionalities.
# C code to RISC-V tool
In this section, we'll explore how C code is reprsented in the instruction set of the RISC-V tool. We'll start by testing the GCC compiler with a simple program that counts the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
STEP 1:
Write the C program that counts the sum of numbers from 1 to n in the Leafpad editor(open source graphical text editor) and save the code.

Compile the code using GCC editor and ouput is generated using "./a.out" command.
